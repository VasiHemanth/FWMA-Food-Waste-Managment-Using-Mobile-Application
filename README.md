# FWMA-Food-Waste-Managment-Using-Mobile-Application

A simple idea to reduce food waste contributes a lot of percentage of food that is saved in a year.Prevention of food waste is impossible yet reducing a small amount is relatively manageable. A mobile application is designed for users to simply establish the connection
between the users who are willing to donate or take the food. This mobile application is built with `React Native`, `Firebase SDK (software development kit)` and required services (location
service, monitoring service, analytic service) that render data to process the application according to the userâ€™s ( Vendors and Clients ) needs.
